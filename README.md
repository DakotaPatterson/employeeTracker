  ## Description
  This project is a Employee tracker that uses mysql and node.js to keep track of a companies employees and roles. My motivation was to make an application that allowed users to keep track of their employees and departmnets all in one place. This application allows the user to input all the inofrmation about their employees and then save them to a database, they are also able to delete and add new employees. I have learned that using mysql to store databases and have them avaliable for use when needed is a great way to stay organized and have clean code.
